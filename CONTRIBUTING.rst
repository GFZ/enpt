How to
~~~~~~

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `enpt` for local development.

1. Fork the `enpt` repo on GitLab.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@gitext.gfz-potsdam.de:your_name_here/enpt.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up
   your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv enpt
    $ cd enpt/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the codestyle and the software tests, including
   testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make lint
    $ python -m unittest
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a merge request through the GitLab website.
