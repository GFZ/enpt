0.16.4 (2020-12-10)
-------------------

* Added URL checker CI job and fixed all dead UR


0.16.3 (2020-11-03)
-------------------

* Replaced deprecated 'source activate' by 'conda activate'.
* Updated installation instructions.
* Fixed DeprecationWarning (Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is
  deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.9 it will stop working)


0.16.2 (2020-10-12)
-------------------

* Added missing requirement 'scikit-image'.


0.16.1 (2020-10-12)
-------------------

* Added pygrib to pip installation instructions.
* Added test, doc and lint requirements as optional requirements to setup.py.


0.16.0 (2020-10-12)
-------------------

* Replaced deprecated function 'add_stylesheet' in conf.py.
* Use SPDX license identifier and set all files to GLP3+ to be consistent with license headers in the source files.
* EnPT is now on conda-forge! Updated the installation instructions accordingly. Added conda badge.
* Revised requirements and environment_enpt.yml.


0.15.0 (2020-09-21)
-------------------

* Added functionality to apply co-registration between an EnMAP image and a user-provided spatial reference dataset
  (still needs to be improved but can already be used). This includes: Spatial_Optimizer class, Test_Spatial_Optimizer
  class, updated config parameters, spatial reference test image.


0.14.1 (2020-09-01)
-------------------

* Updated installation instructions to include SICOR installation there.
* Some adaptions to recent changes in py_tools_ds and pyproj.


0.14.0 (2020-08-14)
-------------------

* Implemented new configuration option (parameter 'drop_bad_bands') to leave out certain water absorption bands from
  processing.
* Bugfix for allowing directories at filename config parameters.
* Total runtime is now printed.


0.13.2 (2020-08-11)
-------------------

* Fixed issue #37 (Empty FileNotFoundError in case no DEM is provided by the user). If no DEM is provided by the user,
  an average elevation (default=0) is used instead. Added corresponding warning and log messages.
* Fixed exception in case an average elevation is passed.
* Fixed a bug that caused 0 or 1 integers provided in the config parameters to be converted to booleans.
* User-provided file paths are now validated directly on startup.
* DEM_Processor instance can now be created from an average elevation (returns a flat DEM).
* RPC geolayer generators are now also compatible with an integer as input elevation.


0.13.1 (2020-08-07)
-------------------

* Updated the minimal version of sensormapgeo. This reduces the memory consumption during orthorectification when
  running in multiprocessing. Fixes issue #59 (High memory consumption of orthorectification causes deadlock or crash
  on smaller machines.)


0.13.0 (2020-05-18)
-------------------

* Renamed DEM for Arcachon test dataset.
* Fixed typo.
* Added config parameter 'output_format'.
* Implementated ENVI output format.
* Fixed log message.
* The output interleave is now also configurable via the parameter 'output_interleave'.
* Implemented 3 new config parameters: 'target_projection_type', 'target_epsg' and 'target_coord_grid'. This allows
  the user to choose between UTM and geographic L2A projection, to specify a custom L2A projection by providing an
  EPSG code or to specify a certain L2A coordinate grid.
* Added 'grid_res' and 'epsg' attributes to EnMAP_Metadata_L2A_MapGeo object.
* The L2A projection metadata is now correctly written to the XML file.


0.12.8 (2020-05-13)
-------------------

* L2A METADATA.XML now contains correct band characteristics, band statistics and information about the merged
  VNIR/SWIR cube (fixes issue #53).


0.12.7 (2020-05-12)
-------------------

* Revised RPC_3D_Geolayer_Generator such that the geolayer computation is now only executed for bands with differing
  RPC coefficients. Since we only have one set of RPC coefficients per detector by now, this speeds up the geolayer
  generation by the factor 20-50.
* Added Test_RPC_3D_Geolayer_Generator class.
* Added natsort to dependencies.
* Optimized RPC_3D_Geolayer_Generator algorithm to further reduce computation time. Its now 2-3x faster.
  Revised and added corresponding tests.


0.12.6 (2020-05-09)
-------------------

* DN2TOARadiance() now returns float32 radiance instead of float64.
* Bugfix in Orthorectifier._get_common_extent().
* Revised Geometry_Transformer and Geometry_Transformer_3D classes.
* Updated minimal version of sensormapgeo which makes the orthorectification much faster (factor 6-10)
  and fixes the deadlock within sensormapgeo.
* Bilinear orthorectification now uses 8 neighbours instead of 32 which makes it much faster.


0.12.5 (2020-05-04)
-------------------

* Dead-pixel correction is now called once more after AC to correct possible spectral spikes due to fringe effect.


0.12.4 (2020-05-04)
-------------------

* Revised computation of the common VNIR/SWIR extent within orthorectification (fixes issue #34). This computation now
  also respects deviations in per-band geolayers due to keystone or misregistrations.
* All pixels that have values in VNIR or SWIR only are not set to nodata in the L2A output (fixes issue #34).
* Nodata values of masks are now set.


0.12.3 (2020-04-21)
-------------------

* Fixed issue #50 (Quicklook images only contain noise).
* Fix for using the wrong bands for the SWIR quicklook image.


0.12.2 (2020-04-21)
-------------------

* L1B masks are now correctly written to the L2A output (fixes issue #48). However, the dead pixel map and the quality
  test flags are still missing.
* Silenced warning during closing of logging handler.


0.12.1 (2020-04-20)
-------------------

* Tests now use Arcachon test data as of 02/2020.

* Added mask attributes to sensor geometry image classes.
* Mask paths are now correctly set.
* Masks are now read from disk.
* Added subclasses EnMAP_VNIR_SensorGeo and EnMAP_SWIR_SensorGeo.
* Added functionality to set SWIR raster attributes with VNIR raster attributes tranformed to SWIR sensor geometry.
* The enmap_ImageL1 instance passed to SICOR now features a 'mask_water' attribute.
* Revised test_l1b_reader.py.
* Combined 'mask_water' and 'mask_land' attributes to 'mask_landwater'.
* Renamed metadata attribute 'filename_mask_deadpixel' to 'filename_deadpixelmap' for consistency.
