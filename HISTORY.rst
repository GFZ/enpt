  EPSG code or to specify a certain L2A coordinate grid.

-------------------

* Revised RPC_3D_Geolayer_Generator such that the geolayer computation is now only executed for bands with differing
  RPC coefficients. Since we only have one set of RPC coefficients per detector by now, this speeds up the geolayer
  generation by the factor 20-50.
* Added Test_RPC_3D_Geolayer_Generator class.
* Added natsort to dependencies.
* Optimized RPC_3D_Geolayer_Generator algorithm to further reduce computation time. Its now 2-3x faster.

* Updated minimal version of sensormapgeo which makes the orthorectification much faster (factor 6-10)
  and fixes the deadlock within sensormapgeo.

  also respects deviations in per-band geolayers due to keystone or misregistrations.
* All pixels that have values in VNIR or SWIR only are not set to nodata in the L2A output (fixes issue #34).
* Nodata values of masks are now set.
